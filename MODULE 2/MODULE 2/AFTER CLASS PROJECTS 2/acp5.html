        Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually
        round,
        flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
        (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high
        temperature,
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is
        known
        as a pizzaiolo.
