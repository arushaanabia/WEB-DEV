    <p class="mt-5">
        
            I enjoy spending my free time on small activities that make my day better.
            In the morning, I usually start with a warm cup of <mark>tea ☕</mark>.
            It helps me wake up slowly and feel refreshed.
            After that, <pre>I like to go for a short walk 🚶‍♂️</pre>.
            Breathing fresh air always gives me a good start to the day 🌿.
            When I return home, <code>I often prepare a simple breakfast 🍞</code>.
            Eggs and bread are my usual choice, sometimes with fruit 🍎.
            During the afternoon, I like to read books 📖.
            I dont read for long hours, but even a few pages relax me.
            In the evening, I spend some time with family 👨‍👩‍👦.
            We talk, laugh, and share about our day 😊.
            Sometimes, I play a few <abbr title="video games">VG</abbr> 🎮 to relax. 
            Listening to music 🎶 is also part of my daily routine.
            At night, I prefer to write a little journal ✍️.
            Finally, I end the day with gratitude and sleep early to wake up early the next day🌙.
            Because i live by the quote-
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” </p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer">Benjamin Franklin</footer>


            </blockquote>
