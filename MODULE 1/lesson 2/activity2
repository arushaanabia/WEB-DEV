        <p> <b>It happens to us all.</b> You wake up and you're hungry but you're just not in the mood for the <strong>breakfast</strong> you've had the
        past week. You want something <mark>different</mark>, but as you look in your <i>refrigerator and cupboards</i>, there doesn't seem to be
        anything that's <em>appealing</em>. You want something new but you have no idea what that new is. By looking at pictures of
        different breakfast ideas, <small>you're sure to come across a bunch of new ideas </small>that you have never before <mark>considered.</mark>
        Hopefully, a <sup>few</sup> of those will sound appealing and you have been inspired to try something new for breakfast. It's also
        great to look through all the <sub>random breakfast </sub>ideas the night before so you can be inspired and choose your breakfast
        <del>for the next morning.</del>
